# SpeakUp

This project is an open source and user-friendly, web-based text-to-speech converter tool which functions by processing texts and generating an audio output that replicates human speech into multiple languages including English, Chinese, Indonesian, French and much more. Our project focuses on lending a helping hand towards visually-impaired individuals and it could also be used for various other purposes including reading texts and ebooks aloud, as well as in navigation systems and for voice assistantance.
